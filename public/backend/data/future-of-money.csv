In addition  N26 said it would provide the service for customers in Belgium  Portugal and Ireland.
Last year  N26 began offering crypto trading for some customers in Austria only  in its first foray into the asset class.
The prices of major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether have fallen sharply over the past year as a broader downturn in global markets prompted investors to ditch risky assets and following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Frieds FTX.
N26 said it would roll out the expanded trading gradually over the coming weeks.
Founded in 2013  the Berlin-based bank has been cited by regulators for lapses in its anti-money laundering controls. The bank has said that it has made improvements.

The No.1 cryptocurrency has clocked a 26% gain in January  leaping 22% in the past week alone  breaking back above the $20 000 level and putting in on course for its best month since October 2021 - just before the Big Crypto Crash.
Ether has also risen  by 29% this year  helping drive the value of the overall global cryptocurrency market above $1 trillion  according to CoinGecko.
""After a rough year last year for cryptos  we are seeing a form of mean reversion "" said Jake Gordon  analyst at Bespoke Investment Group  referring to the theory of asset prices returning to long-term averages.
Researchers said investor bets on a rosier macroeconomic picture were driving a jump in riskier assets across the board.
Few crypto tokens have benefited more than bonk  which was launched at the end of December on the Solana blockchain and had rocketed 5 000% by early January. It has since fallen back  though remains up 910% since the start of the year.
It is the latest entrant to the hyper-volatile world of meme coins  cryptocurrencies inspired by online memes and jokes  and is modeled after the same grinning Shiba Inu dog as dogecoin - which itself was catapulted to fame by Elon Musk tweets.
Bonks a puppy  though.
Even at its peak it was worth just $0.000004873759 with a market capitalization of about $205 million.
Other meme tokens are also up  with dogecoin and Shiba Inu up 19% and 27% respectively in 2023.
But buyers beware.
""Investors need to be especially cautious when it comes to coins like doge  Shiba Inu and bonk "" said Les Borsai  co-founder of digital assets services firm Wave Financial.
""They fall just as hard as they surge.""
Nonetheless  some market players pointed to the relative cheapness of these tokens - doge is worth about eight cents - as a reason why speculators were willing to place bets on them.
""Meme coins belong to crypto  its part of the culture "" said Martin Leinweber  digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes. ""It just takes a few lines of codes to create a meme token and if you have a community for it  people love that.""
Bonk is a meme coin with a mission. It was created  in part  to support the Solana blockchain  which has seen an exodus of funds and users since crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy in November  and its native Solana token drop over 37%.
The Solana token has now indeed jumped as bonk has gained traction: its up 131% in 2023  the biggest gainer among major cryptocurrencies.
""Rumors of Solanas death seem to have been greatly exaggerated "" said Tom Dunleavy  senior research analyst at data firm Messari. ""Despite the recent price appreciation seemingly being driven by speculation  the underlying ecosystem remains quite strong.""
Some researchers chalked the crypto gains up to optimism that inflation had peaked  reducing the need for tighter central bank policy.
""Bitcoin and crypto tend to front-run everything  which is why weve seen notable relative strength in this asset class of late "" said Wave Financials Borsai.
Theres certainly been an increase in activity.
The dollar value of bitcoin trading volumes on major exchanges over a 7-day period jumped to $151 million  the highest in nearly two months  according to data from Blockchain.com.
Total bitcoin flows - representing all uses including trading and payments - have increased by 13 130 bitcoin on average in the last 7 days  the largest rise in 64 days  Chainalysis data showed.
However  market watchers warned against celebrating too soon  noting trading volumes remained low and the macroeconomic environment uncertain.
""Its too early to declare a definitive reversal for the crypto market despite the recent strength weve seen of late "" said Aaron Kaplan  co-founder of Prometheum  a digital asset securities trading platform.
""If interest rate increases are below what the market expects  then risk assets will benefit and crypto prices will likely continue the uptrend  but theres just too much uncertainty right now.""

Allaire said blockchain technology itself should be viewed similarly to an operating system  while individual use cases should be regulated separately.
""New definitions ... would help provide more clarity on which regulators are involved in what activity "" Allaire told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on the sidelines of the World Economic Forums annual meeting in Davos.

Britain is due to launch a public consultation in coming weeks on what should be the legal attributes of a digital pound - if it was decided to go ahead and launch one - which backers say would mean faster transactions.
Bailey told parliaments Treasury Select Committee on Monday that he was not sure if a digital pound was needed for now.
The Bank is updating its real-time gross settlement system (RTGS)  which holds the accounts of Britains banks  building societies and other institutions at the BoE.
""I think its an open question whether a wholesale digital central bank currency is needed because weve got a wholesale central bank money settlement system with a major upgrade "" Bailey said.
Bailey was also cautious about a digital pound for retail use such as for making payments  adding there is no plan to abolish cash.
""We have to be very clear what problem we are trying to solve here before we get carried away by the technology and the idea "" he said.
He was not convinced that retail payment systems ""need this sort of upgrade at the moment"".
Meanwhile  euro zone finance ministers on Monday said they backed continued preparatory work for a potential digital euro  now being studied by the European Central Bank.
The EU is due to publish a draft law this year on how a digital euro would fit into the blocs laws.
""The Eurogroup considers that the introduction of a digital euro as well as its main features and design choices requires political decisions that should be discussed and taken at the political level "" the ministers said in a joint statement.
A digital euro should complement  and not replace cash  and an ""offline functionality"" should be explored to serve a wider range of uses and contribute to financial inclusion  the ministers said.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-probes-ftx-collapse-employees-turn-law-firm-covington-2023-01-13/,As U.S. probes FTX collapse  employees turn to law firm Covington,2023-01-13,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/bqLyTR0EvBeght_SaR3ujb2qBZE=/1080x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PGPRDZLFNRPAJHOW5QMHIQJSR4.jpg,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/l7whG4LgoFHymT7XgxovwSbkuDE=/480x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PGPRDZLFNRPAJHOW5QMHIQJSR4.jpg,Several FTX employees have turned to law firm Covington & Burling to help them deal with questions from U.S. authorities investigating the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange and actions by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried  three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.,"NEW YORK  Jan 13 (Reuters) - Several FTX employees have turned to law firm Covington & Burling to help them deal with questions from U.S. authorities investigating the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange and actions by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried  three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Arlo Devlin-Brown  a New York-based Covington partner and former Manhattan federal prosecutor  is acting as so-called pool counsel representing current FTX employees as individuals being asked to share information with prosecutors and regulators  said the people  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Companies facing wide-ranging investigations often hire pool counsel for employees. The use of pool counsel suggests that federal prosecutors in Manhattan probing FTXs collapse may be interested in questioning a deep roster of employees.
Bankman-Fried  30  was arrested in December on charges of stealing customer funds to plug losses at his hedge fund  Alameda Research  and lying to investors and lenders.
The one-time billionaire pleaded not guilty. Two close associates pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Damian Williams  the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan  has urged others with knowledge of wrongdoing to come forward.
""Its nerve-wracking to participate in an interview with the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys office  regardless of your personal exposure "" said Sarah Krissoff  a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan and now a partner at Day Pitney.
Employers pay for pool counsel  which represents employees who tend not to have significant exposure to criminal charges themselves  but may be unnerved by the process of speaking with authorities  Krissoff explained.
The use of pool counsel enables a single legal team to gain expertise in the case  making it more efficient than having each employee retain individual lawyers  Krissoff said. She added that pool counsel must be swift to identify potential conflicts among their clients and urge individuals to find their own attorneys when appropriate.
The arrangement does not mean Covington is representing FTX  which has turned to Sullivan & Cromwell  another law firm.
FTX declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11 after a wave of customer withdrawals spurred by concerns the exchange had commingled funds with Alameda.
Many former FTX executives  including its former top lawyer Daniel Goldberg  have hired their own lawyers to guide them through the process of potentially cooperating with prosecutors.
Reuters could not determine how many FTX employees are being represented by Covington  nor what information - if any - the employees have provided to prosecutors  the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  which are all investigating.
Spokesmen for Covington  Bankman-Fried and the U.S. Attorneys office in Manhattan all declined to comment. FTX did not respond to a request for comment.
Devlin-Brown joined Covington in 2016 following nearly 11 years at the U.S. Attorneys office in Manhattan. As a member of the offices securities and commodities fraud unit he prosecuted Steven Cohens hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors  which pleaded guilty to insider trading.
He was later promoted to chief of the offices public corruption unit  where he oversaw the cases against former top New York State legislators Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos  who were convicted on corruption charges.
FTX is now run by corporate restructuring expert John Ray  who oversaw the liquidation of Enron. Ray has met with prosecutors  sources told Reuters in December.
In a Nov. 17 statement filed in bankruptcy court  Ray wrote that FTX needed employees to stay on to help ""establish accountability  preserve value and maximize stakeholder recoveries.""

The volatility often associated with meme stocks has been on display this week. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O)  which had soared earlier in the week  fell more than 30% on Friday. The New York Times reported that the company is in talks with private equity firm Sycamore Partners for the sale of its assets as part of a possible bankruptcy process.
The companys shares are still up 45% this month  after hitting a three-decade low last week when the retailer warned it could seek bankruptcy protection.
Carvana Co (CVNA.N) shares  meanwhile  are up nearly 50% this month amid heavy short interest  despite reversing some of those gains on Friday. Shares of older meme stocks have joined in the rally  with GameStop Corp (GME.N) up 11% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) up around 24%.
A 1 600% rise in shares of GameStop in early 2021 first put the spotlight on meme stocks and the retail investors that helped drive many of their rallies as they coordinated in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Though many of those initial rallies have since sputtered  meme stocks have seen a number of short-lived rebounds since then  often coinciding with resurging risk appetite in broader markets.
Signs of easing inflation that some investors believe may push the Federal Reserve to end its rate increases sooner than projected appear to be contributing to the latest moves in meme stocks while also helping push up the S&P 500  which is up 3.5% this year. The index fell more than 19% in 2022.
""When we get a little bit of easing in inflation expectations … risk appetite comes back on and retail investors tend to pile into [meme stocks] in hopes of this lottery-like payoff "" said Garrett DeSimone  head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.
Meanwhile  the Cboe Volatility Index  known as Wall Street’s fear gauge because it reflects demand for downside protection  was recently at 18.3  near its lowest level since Jan 22.
""The rally in risk assets has carried meme stocks in its wake "" said Jason Benowitz  senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt.
Also  “investors who sold for tax reasons in late 2022 might be reinvesting in early 2023 "" he said.
Analysts at Vanda Research noted that January and February tend to be among the strongest months for retail inflows.
“Moreover  retail investors tend to rev up their purchases heading into the earnings reporting season  as heightened volatility presents more opportunities for attractive returns ” Vanda’s analysts wrote.
Market participants are quick to warn that similar rallies in meme stocks - as well as broader markets - have crumbled in the last year. GameStop shares are down more than 75% from their peak  while Bed Bath & Beyond shares  which surged to above $20 last year  quickly reversed those gains. A number of bounces in the S&P 500 last year also crumbled.
Despite the renewed buying from retail investors  ""the hurdle to reach previous net-flow highs looks difficult  and any meme stock mania is poised to be short-lived  in our view "" Vanda analysts wrote.

Genesis froze customer withdrawals in November and said it was trying to avoid a bankruptcy filing. It owes its creditors more than $3 billion  according to a person familiar with the matter.
Genesis owner  DCG  is also the parent company of several high-profile crypto firms  including crypto asset manager Grayscale  and its website lists more than 160 companies in its venture capital portfolio. DCG is considering offloading parts of that portfolio to raise money  the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
Sun told Reuters in an interview he would be willing to spend up to $1 billion to buy some of DCGs assets  ""depending on their evaluation of the situation"".
Sun did not specify which assets he was considering buying.
His spokesperson did not disclose details of Suns wealth  but said it consisted of crypto and traditional currencies.
Digital Currency Group declined to comment.
Sun is the founder of a blockchain network called TRON and an advisor to the crypto exchange Huobi  which last week announced plans to lay off about 20% of its staff.
High-profile crypto players have in the past publicly expressed interest in buying other firms or their assets when there were market concerns about those firms financial health  but such deals do not necessarily materialize.
When major crypto exchange FTX faced a rush of investor withdrawals in November  Binance said it had signed a no-nbinding agreement to buy FTXs non-U.S. unit. A day later Binance said it dropped the plan after doing due diligence.
As FTX sought emergency funding  Bloomberg reported that Sun said he was prepared to provide ""billions"" in aid. That deal also did not take place.

Genesis  a part of Digital Currency Group  entered into a deal with Gemini in December 2020 to offer Gemini customers the chance to loan their crypto assets to Genesis in exchange for earning interest  the SEC said. Beginning in February 2021  they raised billions of dollars worth of crypto assets from investors  the SEC said.
The firms violated securities laws through the offer and sale of crypto assets through their Gemini Earn product  the SEC said.
In a Twitter post  Gemini co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Tyler Winklevoss called the complaint disappointing and said the company looks forward to defending itself.
""This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive "" he said.
Genesis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In November 2022  Genesis told investors they could not withdraw their crypto assets as volatility in the crypto markets prompted a liquidity crunch. At the time  Genesis had about $900 million in assets from 340 000 Gemini Earn investors. The investors have been unable to withdraw their assets  the regulator said.
Investigations into other  related violations are ongoing  the agency said.
In February 2022  a subsidiary of rival crypto firm BlockFi Inc. agreed to pay $100 million to the SEC and 32 states to settle charges related to their offering of a similar interest-bearing product.
Gemini and other Genesis creditors have been agitating for a solution to avoid a situation similar to FTXs rapid descent into bankruptcy. Genesis owes creditors more than $3 billion  according to a person familiar with the matter.
Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss publicly called for the ouster of DCG Chief Executive Barry Silbert on Tuesday  accusing Silbert of defrauding creditors and engaging in ""bad faith stall tactics."" DCG has called Winklevoss allegations false and defamatory.

The cryptocurrency market floundered in 2022  as risk appetite diminished and various crypto firms collapsed. Investors were left with large losses and regulators stepped up calls for more consumer protection.
Even as overall crypto transaction volumes fell  the value of crypto transactions related to illicit activity rose for the second year running  Chainalysis said.
Transactions associated with sanctioned entities increased more than 100 000-fold in 2022 and made up 44% of last years illicit activity  Chainalysis said.
Funds received by the Russian exchange Garantex  which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in April  accounted for ""much of 2022s illicit volume""  Chainalysis said  adding that most of that activity is ""likely Russian users using a Russian exchange."" A spokesperson for Chainalysis said wallets are tagged as ""illicit"" if they are part of a sanctioned entity.
Garantex did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The United States also imposed sanctions last year on cryptocurrency mixing services Blender and Tornado Cash  which it said were being used by hackers  including from North Korea  to launder billions of dollars worth of proceeds from their cyber crimes.
The volume of stolen crypto funds rose 7% last year  but other illicit crypto transactions including those related to scams  ransomware  terrorism financing and human trafficking  saw volumes fall.
""The market downturn may be one reason for this "" Chainalysis said. ""Weve found in the past that crypto scams  for instance  take in less revenue during bear markets.""
Chainalysis said its $20.1 billion estimate only includes activity recorded on blockchain  and excludes ""off-chain"" crime such as fraudulent accounting by crypto firms.
The figure also excludes when cryptocurrencies are the proceeds of non-crypto-related crimes  such as when cryptocurrency is used as a means of payment in drug trafficking  Chainalysis said.
""We have to stress that this is a lower bound estimate - our measure of illicit transaction volume is sure to grow over time "" the report said  noting that the figure for 2021 was revised to $18 billion from $14 billion as more scams were discovered.

Joseph Bankman  a tax law professor at Stanford Law School  has tapped Sean Hecker of Kaplan Hecker and Fink LLP  the source said.
Hecker  who focuses on white collar crime  previously represented a former top foreign exchange trader at Barclays accused of an alleged multi-billion-dollar fraud scheme. In a rare move  a federal judge tossed out that case immediately after prosecutors presented it.
Bankman had closely advised his son ever since Bankman-Fried launched his hedge fund Alameda Research in 2017  according to three former FTX executives. In his later consulting work for FTX  Bankman helped arrange meetings in Washington for his son  the sources said.
Bankman is cooperating with prosecutors  the source said  without elaborating. Reuters could not determine what information  if any  Bankman had given prosecutors. A spokesperson for Bankman declined to comment for this article. Bankman could not be reached for comment by phone and email.
While it is unclear if prosecutors view Bankman as having any personal liability in the alleged fraud scheme  the scrutiny of the case highlights that the net of individuals caught up in the FTX scandal is wide. Bankman-Fried  who was arrested and released on bail  has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges and is due to go to trial in October.
A spokeperson for the DOJ declined to comment about Bankman.
The Justice Department  Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed charges against Bankman-Fried last month. He is accused of diverting billions of dollars in FTX client deposits to Alameda to bankroll venture investments  luxury real estate purchases  and political donations.
He clinched a bail deal with prosecutors late last month that saw him released from jail in exchange for a $250-million bond  secured against his parents property. The deal required Bankman-Fried to remain in confinement with Bankman and his mother Barbara Fried at their home in Palo Alto  California.
Two other former top associates  former Alameda chief executive Caroline Ellison and former FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang  have both pleaded guilty to defrauding investors and agreed to cooperate.
Bankman was closely involved at Alameda and FTX  the former executives said. In 2017  he personally recruited Daniel Friedberg  who became FTXs long-time top lawyer  one of the people said. Reuters reported last week that Friedberg had cooperated with prosecutors. He also accompanied Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas in early November while his son tried to secure emergency funding.
Both Bankman-Frieds parents  as well as senior executives of the failed crypto exchange  bought properties in the Bahamas over the last two years  Reuters has previously reported. At the time  a spokesperson for the two said only that they had been trying to return the property to FTX.
Bankmans spokesperson declined to comment when asked about the status of those properties.

Genesis said it is working to avoid a bankruptcy  but investors fear its collapse could bring down other connected companies and projects.
Here is what we know about the many companies Digital Currency Group owns:
DCG acquired crypto news website CoinDesk in 2016 after previously investing in the outlet. TechCrunch at the time pegged the deal as being worth about $500 000 to $600 000.
CoinDesk in November published a leaked balance sheet of Alameda Research  the crypto trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Many industry observers cited the report as the catalyst for the downfall of Alameda and Bankman-Frieds crypto exchange FTX  which filed for bankruptcy less than two weeks later.
Genesis Trading was originally the bitcoin trading division at DCG Chief Executive Barry Silberts SecondMarket  but relaunched with its new name as a subsidiary of DCG when Silbert started the venture firm in 2015.
Genesis crypto lending arm  Genesis Global Capital  announced in November its crypto lending arm would stop making new loans and blocked customers from withdrawing funds  citing the market dislocation caused by the collapse of FTX.
Genesis Global Capital had partnered with a number of other crypto companies  including crypto exchange Gemini  to offer a crypto lending product. Gemini now says its customers are owed $900 million from Genesis.
Genesis owes more than $3 billion to its creditors including Gemini  according to a person familiar with the matter.
DCG itself owes $1.675 billion to Genesis crypto lending arm  according to a November letter Silbert sent to shareholders. That includes a $1.1 billion promissory note that appears to be connected with liabilities DCG assumed from Genesis after it was hit hard by the collapse of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.
Silbert started Grayscale Investments in 2013 after he stepped down as CEO of SecondMarket. After selling SecondMarket to Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) in 2015  he launched DCG  with Grayscale as one of the firms subsidiaries.
Grayscales flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the worlds largest bitcoin fund  one that the company hopes will someday be converted into an exchange-traded fund.
GBTC has not traded at a premium relative to the price of bitcoin  its underlying asset  since early 2021. DCG embarked on an effort to reduce the discount in 2021  announcing a plan to spend up to $1 billion to purchase GBTC shares.
Troubles at Genesis lending business had no impact on DCG and its subsidiaries  DCG said in November  while Grayscale said its underlying assets were unaffected.
DCG is a prolific venture capital investor  listing more than 160 companies in its portfolio on its website  of which it has acquired 28  it says. Crypto exchange Luno and crypto mining and staking firm Foundry are listed as subsidiaries.
DCG is also an investor in U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN.O) and Kraken  and its other holdings include the U.S. firm Circle  which runs the stablecoin USDC  and blockchain analytics companies Chainalysis  Dune Analytics  Elliptic and Etherscan.

DCG is considering offloading parts of its venture capital holdings to raise money  the Financial Timesreported Thursday. DCGs portfolio includes 200 crypto-related projects such as exchanges  banks and custodians in at least 35 countries  and are worth about $500 million  the report added.
Genesis declined to comment. DCG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several crypto companies have lately been under pressure as they try to navigate unprecedented industry-wide turmoil amid waning investor appetite for digital assets after major exchange FTX blew up late last year.
Earlier this month  Genesis – which brokers digital assets for financial institutions like hedge funds and asset managers -cut 30% of its workforce in a second round of layoffs in less than six months  according to a person familiar with the matter.
Meanwhile  its parent DCG saw calls from Cameron Winklevoss  co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini  for the removal of DCGs chief executive officer  Barry Silbert  earlier this week amid tensions between the high-profile executives.
Stamford  Connecticut-based DCG is also the parent company of several high-profile crypto firms  including crypto asset manager Grayscale.

The registration allows Binance to launch a website in Swedish and in other ways market itself directly to consumers in the Nordic country  Per Nordkvist  deputy head of the Financial Supervisory Authoritys banks division  told Reuters.
Binance accounts for over half the global crypto trading market. With its registration in Sweden  it has now received regulatory permissions or approvals in 15 jurisdictions  including several European Union states and Australia and New Zealand.
The core of the companys business  the giant Binance.com exchange  last year processed trades worth over $22 trillion.
Binance  founded by CEO Changpeng Zhao in Shanghai in 2017  has declined to reveal where the exchange is based.
A Reuters analysis in December of Binances corporate filings in 14 jurisdictions showed that the Binance.com exchange remains mostly hidden from public view.
The public filings do not show  for example  how much money flows between the units and Binance.com. The Reuters analysis also found that several of the units appear to have little activity.
Binance said in a statement shared on Thursday by its CEO on Twitter that with the latest registration  Swedish residents can legally access services including crypto trading and withdrawing and depositing euros on the exchange.
However  Nordkvist said  the registration of the local unit  Binance Nordics AB  does not mean that the company is fully supervised by the watchdog.
Unlike licensed financial services providers  companies that are registered are obliged to provide the Swedish watchdog with information on anti-money laundering measures but little more.
""Binance continues to demonstrate its commitment to work closely with regulatory agencies to uphold global standards "" Richard Teng  Binances head of Europe and MENA  said in a blog post on Wednesday.

The bill  backed by ruling party lawmakers allied with President Nayib Bukele  aims to attract national and foreign investors while creating new financing opportunities for citizens  companies and the government.
Lawmakers in the unicameral Congress dominated by Bukeles New Ideas party passed the proposal in an overwhelming majority vote of 62 in favor and only 16 opposed.

The law also establishes the creation of the National Commission for Digital Assets and the Bitcoin Funds Administration Agency  which will be in charge of managing  safeguarding  and investing the funds from public offerings of digital assets carried out by the government.
The provisions of the law are not applicable to digital currencies issued by central banks of any country or territory  whether so-called fiat currency issued by those banks or crypto-currencies.
It also would not apply to digital assets that by law are legal tender such as bitcoin  in addition to the video game ecosystem or Non-Fungible Tokens.
Bukeles office did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking whether the new legislation would apply to the launch of bitcoin volcano bonds that the president announced in late 2021.
Nonetheless  President Bukele shared on Twitter a message from the countrys bitcoin office saying the law also paves the way for volcano bonds to be issued soon.
