The cryptocurrency exchange’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Kris Marszalek, blamed “a confluence of negative economic developments” for the reductions, which followed staff cuts that took place last July. The additional reductions were necessary to position Crypto.com for long-term success, he said in a blog post on Friday.
Mr. Marszalek didn’t say how many employees were laid off. Several hundred individuals found out on Friday that they no longer had access to Crypto.com’s systems and were being laid off, according to people familiar with the matter.
In the middle of last year, Singapore-based Crypto.com said that 260 people, or around 5% of its staff, would be made redundant. Mr. Marszalek said in his Friday blog post that the recent implosion of rival exchange FTX had severely damaged trust in the industry.
Several crypto exchanges were hit by heavy withdrawals following the sudden collapse of FTX in November. A misstep by Crypto.com around that time also added to its woes. That month, Mr. Marszalek said the company had mishandled a roughly $400 million transaction.
Mr. Marszalek’s Friday blog post said Crypto.com has more than 70 million users worldwide and the company maintains “a strong balance sheet.”

A Crypto.com spokesperson said in response to queries, “The layoffs will not impact our ability to continue to be a leader in compliance and security, which continue to be critical in our effort to restore trust in the industry.”
Crypto.com’s latest cuts come after similar moves by other crypto exchanges, lenders and other industry players. At least 1,500 crypto jobs have been axed this month alone, including about 950 that were cut at Coinbase Global Inc. this week and reductions at Huobi, another exchange operator. The firms cited the rout in cryptocurrency prices as reasons for the layoffs.
Crypto.com has gained attention for its splashy marketing campaigns in recent years. It featured actor Matt Damon in a commercial in late 2021, and has run ads at the Super Bowl and the recent FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The company earlier bought the rights to rename the arena that is home to the Los Angeles Lakers to Crypto.com Arena, and is also a Formula One sponsor.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-your-guide-to-the-crypto-crash-11669375609,FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried: Your Guide to the Crypto Crash,https://images.wsj.net/im-672194?width=220&height=147,Eric Wallerstein,"Updated Jan. 11, 2023 3:32 pm ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,"The founder of FTX was the paragon of crypto, then the cautionary tale. This guide will help you understand what happened.","Sam Bankman-Fried was heralded as the savior of crypto. Late last year, his empire collapsed. Here’s what you need to know about the unraveling of FTX.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, often referred to as SBF, vaulted to celebrity with his attempts to make his crypto exchange a household name.
The 30-year-old billionaire’s eccentric, unkempt appearance created an aura of genius. Venture capitalists got on board. High-profile athletes and musicians, and a wave of FTX ads, encouraged regular people to use the exchange to tap crypto’s moneymaking potential.
Mr. Bankman-Fried and FTX were among the biggest donors in the 2022 midterm election cycle, boosting their visibility in Washington. And when other crypto firms started collapsing last year, SBF extended loans to prop up ailing competitors.
Before creating FTX, Mr. Bankman-Fried founded Alameda Research, and it became a major player in crypto market making and institutional trading. Mr. Bankman-Fried recruited Caroline Ellison, whom he met while both were traders at Jane Street Capital, and she later became chief executive. Mr. Bankman-Fried remained CEO of FTX, the crypto exchange.
But even when Mr. Bankman-Fried was no longer at Alameda’s helm, he still owned 90% of it, according to bankruptcy filings. Alameda also traded on FTX.
Mr. Bankman-Fried repeatedly said that Alameda didn’t have any special privileges on FTX. Recent revelations cast doubt on those claims. According to bankruptcy filings, Alameda had a “secret exemption” from the exchange’s process for liquidating bad trades—a loophole that meant Alameda could take on more risk than other customers.
Alameda also doled out billions to buy stakes in startups. It often used FTT, which is FTX’s own cryptocurrency, as collateral for borrowing.
Mr. Bankman-Fried and Ms. Ellison were at times romantically involved.
FTX’s problems tumbled into the open on Nov. 2, when CoinDesk published a report questioning the financial health of both FTX and Alameda.
Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of rival exchange Binance, said he would dump his FTT holdings. Customers panicked and started yanking their money out. Crunched for cash, FTX agreed to sell itself to Binance, but Binance quickly changed its mind. Shortly after, SBF resigned and FTX filed for bankruptcy.
Prosecutors and regulators say FTX had been dipping into its customers’ deposits from the start, funneling cash into real estate, political donations, Alameda’s operations, and more.
John J. Ray has helped oversee some of the highest-profile bankruptcies ever, including Enron. Mr. Ray, now the new CEO of FTX, says he has never seen anything as bad as FTX.
In a court filing, Mr. Ray called the disarray at FTX unprecedented. According to him: Supervisors approved payment requests with emojis. Homes were purchased for employees with corporate funds. Bank accounts and company financials weren’t tracked. Software was used to conceal the misuse of customer money.
Many employees have quit, saying they were in the dark.
People are certainly getting worried.
FTX said it has located more than $5 billion in cash and other liquid assets, and is hoping to sell more than 300 additional holdings with a book value of more than $4.6 billion. Those assets don’t include $425 million held by authorities in the Bahamas, company lawyers said in bankruptcy court.
Court filings from Mr. Ray and those working with him make clear that they don’t know how much cash or crypto they will ultimately find.
With a major exchange and trading firm under its umbrella, many loans to and from other players and various tokens with market values once in the billions of dollars, FTX’s tentacles extended wide across the industry.
Crypto lender BlockFi Inc., which got a line of credit from FTX in 2022, followed FTX with its own bankruptcy filing. Genesis Global Capital—which had loans outstanding to Alameda—is trying to quickly raise a heap of cash. Both have paused withdrawals.
With all that in mind, is crypto doomed? Maybe.
Since his departure from FTX, Mr. Bankman-Fried hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. 
In media interviews, Mr. Bankman-Fried has repeatedly said he didn’t intend to commit fraud. He has also tried to distance himself from his trading firm. “I didn’t have enough brain cycles left to understand everything going on at Alameda if I wanted to,” he told The Wall Street Journal.  
Mr. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on Dec. 12. The U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York charged him with eight criminal counts including wire fraud, commodities-fraud conspiracy and securities-fraud conspiracy.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also sued Mr. Bankman-Fried on Dec. 13, alleging that he misused customer funds. The following week he was transferred to U.S. custody.
Mr. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges on Jan. 3. A judge set his trial to begin Oct. 2.
Two former deputies of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s, Ms. Ellison and Gary Wang, have pleaded guilty to similar criminal charges. Ms. Ellison apologized during her court hearing, and Mr. Wang told the judge he knew what he was doing was wrong.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-1-billion-bet-on-a-bitcoin-miner-on-the-kazakh-steppe-11673453716,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Supersized Bet: $1 Billion for a Bitcoin Miner on the Kazakh Steppe,https://images.wsj.net/im-701282?width=220&height=147,Eliot Brown,"Updated Jan. 11, 2023 2:49 pm ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,Genesis Digital is one of the largest assets in the FTX-Alameda wreckage,"Just before crypto markets plunged last year, Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund made a $1 billion bet on Genesis Digital Assets, a Cyprus-registered bitcoin miner rigged to consume a small city’s worth of electricity in Kazakhstan.
The cash injection from Mr. Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research LLC was supersized even for the red-hot crypto startup world, and it dwarfed the FTX founder’s other investments in private companies.
Genesis Digital is now one of the largest assets in the FTX bankruptcy, the product of a globe-spanning spending spree in which Mr. Bankman-Fried’s companies poured money into crypto tokens, arena branding deals and Bahamas real estate.
Extracting value from Genesis Digital could prove difficult. Bitcoin-mining company valuations have plummeted. Only around half of the Alameda funds in Genesis Digital went to the company’s operations, according to Cyprus corporate-registration documents and people familiar with Genesis Digital. More than $500 million bought existing shares from two Genesis Digital co-founders, a detail that hasn’t been previously reported.
A Genesis Digital spokeswoman said that the company received money from Alameda “at market value” in the usual course of fundraising and that its founders own most of the company.
Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital, which invested more than $60 million in Genesis Digital, marked down the value of its stake in the bitcoin miner by 59% between its June peak and September, according to SkyBridge securities filings.
A SkyBridge spokeswoman declined to comment. 
FTX collapsed in November and Mr. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to charges earlier this month in federal court. Prosecutors allege that he defrauded investors and siphoned billions of dollars of FTX customer cash into his hedge fund. FTX’s new management is sorting through precisely where all the cash went.
A key chunk of what remains for FTX and Alameda creditors to pick over are scores of investments in startups such as Genesis Digital. FTX, Alameda and other entities controlled by Mr. Bankman-Fried put more than $5 billion into more than 150 startups, as well as venture firms like Sequoia Capital, according to Alameda company documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Many of those investments were concentrated in the crypto sector itself, adding to the challenges of recovering money in the bankruptcy. 
“It’s a very trying time for the crypto sector, and what I worry about is the impairment to that portfolio of $5 billion because obviously that’s a recovery pool for our customers,” John J. Ray III, FTX’s new CEO, told a U.S. House committee last month. “Many of those investments are likely troubled.”
Thomas Braziel, an investor who buys claims from creditors in bankruptcies, said he expects creditors will eventually get between 20% and 60% of their money back, though years into the future. Given that the venture portfolio was heavily invested in crypto, it is unlikely to contribute much to that total, he said. 
As one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, Genesis Digital is tethered to the crypto market.
Bitcoin mining works like this: Miners process transactions on the network—solving complex equations in a process that rewards them in newly created bitcoin. In the early days of crypto, most of the digital number crunching was done on home computers, before an industry formed of massive, energy-sucking data centers looking to process bitcoin transactions at scale.
When bitcoin prices jumped in 2021, the valuations of large miners surged into the billions of dollars. Given that these companies’ end product is bitcoin, their share prices tend to soar when prices rise and plummet when they fall. With bitcoin down over 70% from peak, shares of many publicly traded miners are down between 70% and 99% in the past year; the largest, Core Scientific Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection last month.
Adding to the challenges is that the price of electricity—a top expense for bitcoin miners—is up sharply.
Genesis Digital got its start in 2017 when a duo of German bitcoin miners joined forces with a trio of Kazakh entrepreneurs. Their plan was to set up bitcoin-mining data centers in Kazakhstan, taking advantage of its relatively cheap, coal-fueled electricity, company executives have said in video interviews posted online. 
The German co-founders, Marco Streng and Marco Krohn, came with several years of bitcoin-mining experience, while the Kazakh businessmen had local ties and a background in commodities.
“We brought our expertise and they brought the technical know-how,” Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, one of the Kazakhstan-based co-founders and its former chairman, said in a Genesis Digital video in 2021, referring to the German co-founders.
Mr. Mirakhmedov was interested in business from an early age, and sold ice cream machines when he was 14, he said in the video. After college, he dove into the commodities market and owned a company in a partnership with commodities giant Trafigura Group.
Another co-founder, Rashit Makhat, had served on the boards of companies owned in part by the Kazakh government, including Kcell, a large telecom firm, according to the companies. 
With access to cheap power in Kazakhstan, Genesis Digital marketed itself as a low-cost provider of bitcoin—one that was able to grow large by building and running its own data centers.
In mid-2021, Mr. Bankman-Fried directed more than $100 million into the company from Alameda, the crypto hedge fund in which he had a 90% stake, according to the company documents. Mr. Bankman-Fried joined the board of Genesis Digital in October 2021.
Mr. Bankman-Fried met the Central Asian country’s president with a group of other foreign investors in December 2021. Around a circular table in the presidential palace—an ornate building that looks like a postmodern White House crowned with a blue Fabergé egg—he urged support for bitcoin mining, among other topics. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev responded with skepticism, citing its high energy use, people familiar with the meeting said.
As Genesis Digital grew and bitcoin prices soared, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s appetite increased. Early in 2022, Alameda invested $550 million in the company. It was part of an investment round that totaled $670 million, according to the people familiar with Genesis Digital.
The proceeds went solely toward buying shares from two co-founders, Messrs. Krohn and Makhat, according to those people and Cyprus corporate records. Records show 70% of the shares transferred from the founders to the investors were from Mr. Makhat. Both men remain company shareholders, according to the corporate records. 
The so-called secondary sale, in which founders or early investors sell some of their shares to other private investors, was large by industry standards, although the practice increased in popularity as the market for startups grew frenzied in 2021.
Months later, Alameda put in another $500 million. This time it was for newly issued shares, and the money would go toward expanding Genesis Digital’s operations. In total, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund invested more than $1.1 billion, according to the Alameda company documents. That gave Alameda a 20% stake, according to Cyprus registration records.
Genesis Digital in a statement to Kazakh media in June highlighted the “serious compliance procedures” at Mr. Bankman-Fried’s operations.
Mr. Bankman-Fried told other investors he liked companies such as Genesis Digital because they were a different way to bet on the future of bitcoin, according to people familiar with the matter.
And bitcoin miners liked Kazakhstan, especially after China banned most bitcoin mining.
In mid-2021, the former Soviet republic was estimated to be home to nearly a fifth of the world’s bitcoin mining, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool developed by a research center at the University of Cambridge. Genesis Digital had 280 megawatts of installed capacity, according to information the company provided to the Kazakh government, equivalent to the consumption of roughly 100,000 U.S. homes. The company told local media in mid-2022 that Kazakhstan accounted for as much as a quarter of its business.
More recently, the local government has grown wary of the strain the crypto industry places on the electricity grid and has cut off power to some miners. It also increased the tariff on electricity use for crypto miners starting this month by more than 20 times, said Janibek Mukhamejanov, a director in the country’s Digital Development and Innovations Ministry. 
Genesis Digital’s investors urged a faster pivot away from Kazakhstan than the company had previously planned, according to company investors. Some of the money it got from Alameda has gone into new data centers in Texas and South Carolina. Most of its mining now takes place in the U.S., the company investors said.
Mr. Bankman-Fried resigned from Genesis Digital’s board on Nov. 10 amid pressure from his fellow investors, according to some of the people familiar with Genesis Digital. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection the following day.

said that it would eliminate around 20% of its staff and enact broad cost cuts, the latest sign of pain in the cryptocurrency industry.
Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said in a blog post Tuesday that crypto exchange Coinbase will reduce operating expenses by 25% from the previous quarter, including laying off about 950 people. At the end of September, the company had around 4,700 employees.
The collapse of rival exchange FTX in November has kick-started a fresh round of layoffs across the industry. Crypto lender Genesis Global Trading Inc. eliminated about a third of its staff last week, and crypto exchange Huobi recently said it plans to lay off about a fifth of its staff.
Digital-asset companies, including Coinbase, also laid off employees last summer after the industry started to wobble.
Mr. Armstrong said that those affected by the layoffs would be informed Tuesday and that U.S. employees would receive a minimum of 14 weeks’ pay.
“Despite everything we’ve been through as a company and an industry, I’m still optimistic about our future and the future of crypto,” Mr. Armstrong said in the post. The layoffs are part of a restructuring plan, which Coinbase expects to be largely completed by the second quarter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Coinbase estimated that it will have between $149 million and $163 million in total restructuring costs, with $58 million to $68 million in expenses related to employee severance benefits.
Coinbase shares rose 13% Tuesday. They plummeted more than 80% in 2022.
In 2021, crypto companies expanded their staffs as a run-up in individual trading and a sharp rise in cryptocurrency prices drove interest in the nascent sector. Coinbase’s staff increased to about 3,700 by the end of 2021 from only about 1,200 at the end of 2020, according to company statements.
Last year forced companies to re-evaluate that quick expansion. The collapse of a pair of sister cryptocurrencies last May knocked down the value of bitcoin and precipitated the fall of a crypto hedge fund and other crypto lenders. This sparked an initial wave of crypto company layoffs, including exchanges Blockchain.com, Crypto.com and Gemini.
The unexpected fall of FTX has compounded that. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, stands accused of stealing billions of dollars of customer funds from his crypto exchange and of defrauding investors and lenders to his trading firm, Alameda Research. He has pleaded not guilty.
Crypto investors are bracing for other companies to downsize or declare bankruptcy. They are closely watching fund outflows from exchanges and the financial health of crypto lender Genesis, one of the largest in the space.

employee was sentenced in a New York federal court Tuesday to 10 months in prison for his role in what prosecutors called the first cryptocurrency insider-trading scheme.
Nikhil Wahi, 27 years old, pleaded guilty last year to one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud, admitting to profiting from confidential information that federal prosecutors say his brother obtained about assets to be listed on the crypto exchange. Mr. Wahi netted nearly $900,000 in proceeds by using the information to trade on digital tokens, according to prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office.
Mr. Wahi, his brother and a friend were charged in the alleged scheme last summer. The brother, Ishan Wahi, who worked on Coinbase’s asset-listing team, previously pleaded not guilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy charges and is awaiting trial. Coinbase said last year that it had fired Ishan Wahi. A lawyer for Ishan Wahi declined to comment.
The friend, Sameer Ramani, remains at large, according to prosecutors.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska said in handing down the sentence that Nikhil Wahi made about 40 trades and tried to conceal the illicit proceeds using anonymous crypto wallets.
“The defendant knew it was wrong and did not see it as a no-harm, no-foul course of conduct,” she said. He must also pay $892,500 in forfeiture, she said.
Mr. Wahi, who is from India, faces deportation after his prison term. He had sought a nonprison sentence, telling the judge that his actions were driven by his guilt and stress over his parents spending their savings on his college education in the U.S. He had hoped to use the ill-gotten proceeds to provide them with a comfortable retirement and to help cover the costs of his father’s declining health, he said.
“I understand my actions are wrong and that is something I will have to live with forever,” he said.
Prosecutors had sought a prison term of 10 to 16 months, citing the frequency of his trades.
“It’s not a case of an isolated error of judgment,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Noah Solowiejczyk told the judge. “It’s doing it over and over and over.”
Mr. Solowiejczyk said that imprisonment would deter others in the crypto industry from participating in insider trading. Judge Preska agreed that a prison term was necessary for public deterrence, though not because of the novelty of the case involving cryptocurrency.
“Insider trading is fraud plain and simple,” she said.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams has aggressively pursued crypto-related crimes over the past year. His office’s efforts are part of a broader push by federal regulators to police digital tokens.
Last month Mr. Williams’s office charged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with stealing billions of dollars from customers of the collapsed crypto exchange while defrauding investors and lenders to his crypto-investment firm Alameda Research. Mr. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have also secured the cooperation of two former associates of Mr. Bankman-Fried, who have pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.
In June, Mr. Williams’s office charged a former employee of the nonfungible-token marketplace OpenSea with fraud and money laundering in what prosecutors said was the first case to involve insider trading of the digital assets. The defendant, Nathaniel Chastain, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.

Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, former federal prosecutors who are now partners in the New York-based boutique firm Cohen & Gresser, are known for an unflashy, roll-up-their-sleeves style to cases, with a meticulous and persistent approach to building a defense, lawyers who know the men say. The pair are up against hard-charging Justice Department lawyers who moved quickly to indict Mr. Bankman-Fried after FTX’s collapse and secured two of his former top lieutenants as cooperating witnesses.
“The swiftness of charging coupled with the cooperators that emerged suggests this is an uphill battle for them,” said Jennifer Rodgers, a former Manhattan colleague of Mr. Everdell’s in the U.S. attorney’s office who praised his work there.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office this past month charged Mr. Bankman-Fried with stealing billions of dollars from FTX customers while misleading investors and lenders connected to his crypto-trading firm Alameda Research. He faces charges of fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and campaign-finance violations and pleaded not guilty last week. The demise of FTX and its impact on other spiraling crypto platforms has made Mr. Bankman-Fried one of the most high-profile white-collar criminal defendants in recent history.
Lawyers from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP had been advising Mr. Bankman-Fried before the federal charges but because of a conflict they referred him to Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the matter.
Messrs. Cohen, 59 years old, and Everdell, 48, have already navigated their client through a thorny extradition from the Bahamas, where Mr. Bankman-Fried had been jailed after the Justice Department requested that local police arrest him.
The two lawyers worked with local counsel to secure his transfer to U.S. custody while negotiating with federal prosecutors his pretrial release under a $250 million bond. They are now tasked with combing through voluminous and technical discovery, including documents relating to FTX investors, debtors and political campaigns.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bankman-Fried has stated that he intends to help customers recover their money, which some lawyers have said could conflict with his own defense.
The two lawyers declined to comment.
Mr. Cohen, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, worked in the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn from 1990 to 1995, where he spent some of his tenure working on business and securities fraud matters. He had a reputation for questioning witnesses in a way that jurors respected, said lawyer Mark Kirsch, who met Mr. Cohen at the office in 1991.
“His light touch when examining witnesses was extremely effective in obtaining information,” Mr. Kirsch said.
Mr. Cohen founded his law firm with attorney Lawrence Gresser in 2002. It has since expanded to have more than 80 lawyers with offices in New York, Washington, London and Paris.
“He’s very entrepreneurial,” said lawyer Mark Zauderer, who shared a client with Mr. Cohen. “He’s expanded rapidly and attracted very able lawyers.”
Joel Cohen, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who isn’t related to Mark, said Mark is his go-to person for referring clients he is unable to represent or for a senior executive needing a separate lawyer. The two men worked together representing a fund manager and analyst at hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Inc. in a yearslong insider-trading case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During the trial, Mark Cohen showcased his ability to make legal arguments on the fly, including a 40-minute back-and-forth with a judge in which he cited case law off the top of his head, Joel Cohen said. He said he only realized Mark was speaking extemporaneously when he saw the legal treatise in front of Mark was turned upside down throughout the exchange.
“He won the argument,” Joel Cohen said. A jury found the defendants not liable in 2014.
Mr. Everdell, a Harvard Law School graduate, worked from 2007 to 2016 as a federal prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office, where he handled cases involving terrorism, complex fraud and money laundering involving a digital currency. He was part of a team that investigated and charged Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, the notorious leader of a Mexican drug cartel who spent decades on the run from authorities. He was among the prosecutors who worked with witnesses to locate the kingpin, who was eventually convicted in a Brooklyn federal court of 10 criminal counts connected to his cartel.
Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor, said Mr. Everdell takes a low-key approach that could be helpful in a high-drama case.
“He’s not a showman,” she said. “He’s a solid, trustworthy lawyer.”
Mr. Everdell joined Mr. Cohen’s firm in 2017.
The two men were part of a legal defense team that advised and represented disgraced Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in late 2021 of sex -trafficking offenses for recruiting underage girls for the disgraced financier. One of Mr. Everdell’s filings in the case led the presiding judge to lower Ms. Maxwell’s recommended potential sentence under federal sentencing guidelines.
White-collar defense lawyer Glen McGorty of Crowell & Moring LLP, who has known Mr. Everdell since college, said he is empathetic when working with a defendant facing serious consequences.
“He’s undaunted by what may seem like an impossible defense,” said Mr. McGorty. “He does the best he can with what he has.”

https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-seeks-to-recoup-sam-bankman-frieds-charitable-donations-11673049354,FTX Seeks to Recoup Sam Bankman-Fried’s Charitable Donations,https://images.wsj.net/im-698573?width=220&height=147,Eric Wallerstein,"Jan. 7, 2023 5:30 am ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,Nonprofits struggle to decide how to handle money received from bankrupt crypto exchange,"Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX doled out millions in charitable donations. Now, new management is asking for it back.
Some of the money, however, has already been spent, and the gifts flowed through myriad sources and agreements that are proving difficult to tally. 
Mr. Bankman-Fried, FTX and its affiliates used stolen customer money to pour billions of dollars into risky wagers that imploded, according to federal prosecutors and regulators. The company collapsed into bankruptcy in November.
Its undoing continues to ripple through the crypto world and beyond it, to academia, nonprofits and politics. FTX’s new management, led by CEO John. J. Ray, says it has been a challenge to determine the company’s assets, liabilities and even how many bank accounts it held. Customers whose money is locked up on the crypto exchange are wondering if they will ever get it back. Mr. Ray has asked for their patience but warned it will be a difficult road. 
Federal prosecutors have said Mr. Bankman-Fried used customer deposits to fund his trading firm and make political donations, and regulators have said he used customer money for personal expenses as well, like buying lavish real estate.
Mr. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to prosecutors’ charges. His spokesman said that charitable donations were all from trading profits, and not from customer deposits.
FTX’s new management is also trying to claw back donations that Mr. Bankman-Fried and other executives made to politicians and political groups. 
The company said in a press release that its new management has been approached by “a number of recipients of contributions or other payments” from FTX that want to return the money. The company has urged others to do the same. For those that don’t, FTX said, it will “commence actions before the bankruptcy court” to require that the money be returned, with interest.
Future Fund, FTX’s primary charitable arm, pledged more than $160 million to more than 110 nonprofits as of September, according to its now-defunct website. Grantees included biotech startups and university researchers working on Covid-19 vaccines and pandemic preparedness studies; programs that provide online resources and mentoring to STEM students in underdeveloped parts of India and China; and a nonprofit building renewable solar panels in communities ranging from Appalachia to the Brazilian Amazon.
Millions of dollars were doled out just in 2022, per Future Fund’s former site, even as crypto prices were crashing. According to the old website: Future Fund pledged $3.6 million to AVECRIS to build the “next generation genetic vaccine platform,” and $5 million to the Atlas Fellowship to support scholarships and a San Francisco-based summer program for high-school students.
One of the largest pledges, according to the old website, was $10 million to biotech startup HelixNano to run “preclinical and Phase 1 trials of a pan-variant Covid-19 vaccine.” 
None of the organizations returned requests for comment.
Mr. Bankman-Fried often said philanthropy was his primary motivation for amassing a fortune.
In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bankman-Fried said the majority of his charitable giving was sincere. But he also said that some was to curry favor with the public.
“When I pledged to give away $2,000 to some brand name charity as part of some promotion related to FTX’s business, that was as much PR as anything else,” Mr. Bankman-Fried told the Journal.
FTX company Blockfolio agreed to make “annual contributions to charities designated by” supermodel Gisele Bündchen, who filmed a commercial with then-husband Tom Brady for FTX. 
The lawyers working through FTX’s bankruptcy have asked to end the partnership along with a number of other sponsorships. A representative for Ms. Bündchen didn’t comment.
The Alignment Research Center, a nonprofit focused on machine learning, announced that it will return its $1.25 million grant from the FTX Foundation, saying the money “morally (if not legally) belongs to FTX customers or creditors.” ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative media outlet, said it would return the $1.6 million it received from Building A Stronger Future, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s family foundation.
Many charities have already spent at least a portion of the money received from FTX. A spokeswoman for the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit think tank supporting plant- and cell-based meat alternatives, said it has already spent all the funds it received from two FTX grants. The spokeswoman said GFI’s legal counsel advised that the odds of having to return grant funds were low, based on their grant agreement.
Stanford Medicine received approximately $4.5 million and was promised another $1 million, a spokeswoman said. She said she couldn’t disclose the amount already spent, but said that the school is holding any remaining funds while it waits for legal clarity. 
A major challenge is figuring out when FTX became insolvent—or whether it was ever solvent in the first place. If a donation was made while FTX was technically unable to pay its creditors, those funds may need to be returned due to bankruptcy laws. 
“This case is all about solvency,” said Dov Kleiner, bankruptcy partner at Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen PC.
Further complicating the clawback process: FTX Foundation may not be considered the same thing as FTX. Recipients who received funds from FTX Foundation rather than FTX itself may have additional protections, he added.
If the court determines FTX was a Ponzi scheme however, the FTX managers could argue that the donations will have to be returned because they were themselves intended to defraud customers and investors.
Mr. Kleiner said he thinks the most likely case is that management tries to settle with nonprofits that received funding.
“People lost money in FTX,” he said. “If you’re a creditor, it’s unfair that they took your deposits and gave it to someone else, even if it’s a charity.”

decrease; red down pointing triangle
forcing it to sell assets at a steep loss to cover some $8.1 billion in withdrawals.
Crypto-related deposits plunged 68% in the fourth quarter, the bank said in an early release of some quarterly results. To satisfy the withdrawals, Silvergate liquidated debt it was holding on its balance sheet. The $718 million it lost selling the debt far exceeds the bank’s total profit since at least 2013.
Silvergate caters to companies in the crypto business. It helps institutional investors move dollars into and out of crypto-trading platforms through its Silvergate Exchange Network, which links the bank accounts of investors and exchanges. 
FTX and other companies controlled by the crypto exchange’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, accounted for about $1 billion of the bank’s deposits. Their November collapse rattled the crypto market and sent Silvergate’s stock down sharply.
Silvergate shares closed down 43% Thursday. The stock has fallen 84% in the past three months. 
Silvergate was able to survive such a steep decline in deposits because it isn’t structured like most banks. It sold off much of its traditional banking operations and branches to focus on providing bank accounts to crypto exchanges and investors. Crypto-related deposits account for some 90% of the bank’s total, and it keeps almost all of its deposits in cash or easy-to-sell securities. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, Silvergate said it had more cash on hand, $4.6 billion, than its $3.8 billion in remaining deposits. And it held another $5.6 billion in debt securities such as U.S. Treasurys that could be sold quickly. Daily average volume on Silvergate’s network rose in the fourth quarter, the bank said. 
Still, a run of that magnitude is highly unusual—even by the standards of the Great Depression. According to a 1938 study by the Federal Reserve, banks that were closed between 1930 and 1933 averaged a deposit decline of nearly 38%. Only nine banks, in a sample of 67, exceeded a 50% decline, the study found.
Banks that failed during the 2008-2009 financial crisis largely saw deposits decline between 10% and 20% on a monthly basis, according to a paper from Fed historian Jonathan D. Rose.
Silvergate said it remains committed to crypto and has the funding to handle a “sustained period of transformation.” 
The withdrawals, executives said, were the result of a loss of confidence in crypto that snowballed after FTX’s collapse. Deposits dropped to as low as $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, before rising again to end the quarter at $3.8 billion. 
On a call with analysts Thursday morning, Silvergate executives said customers didn’t simply close out their accounts; rather, they told the bank they were moving their money out of crypto and thus didn’t need to keep so much of it with Silvergate. Even customers who are focused on digital currencies pulled their cash to invest in supersafe assets like Treasurys, executives said.
“Our customers have taken a huge pause,” Chief Executive Alan Lane said.
The bank started borrowing against its holdings to get the cash needed for withdrawals, but as interest rates continued to increase it faced a mismatch: It was paying more to borrow than it was making in interest on the securities. That forced it to sell the securities, even ones it had previously intended to hold, into a market that was shedding bonds.
Silvergate plans to pare back some business to ride out the downturn. The bank has laid off 40% of its staff and shelved plans to launch its own digital currency, writing off $196 million it spent buying the technology that Facebook had built in its failed attempt to start a crypto-based payments network.
Silvergate has faced intense scrutiny over its relationship with FTX and Mr. Bankman-Fried’s crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research LLC. The companies collapsed in November after it came to light that Alameda used FTX customer funds to fund risky bets.
Mr. Bankman-Fried has blamed the use of customer funds on outdated systems and risk-management failures. In its early days, he has said, FTX didn’t have a bank account, so customers looking to trade on the exchange wired money to Alameda’s bank accounts. Some of that money appears to have been transferred to an account at Silvergate. 
Silvergate has said it is reviewing transactions between FTX and Alameda and suggested it didn’t know that the money going into Alameda was supposed to go to FTX. 
“At Silvergate, we understand and share the concerns being widely expressed that FTX apparently was directing its customers to wire money to Alameda’s accounts,” Mr. Lane wrote in a letter to lawmakers who had questioned the bank’s relationship with Mr. Bankman-Fried’s companies. 
The crypto meltdown also has raised questions about the viability of the bank’s business model. A group of federal regulators earlier this week warned banks against being too exposed to the market. 
Silvergate’s shares are heavily shorted. The trade has been a profitable one, with shorts up more than $400 million in the past year, according to S3 Partners.
Silvergate plans to report full fourth-quarter results later this month.

The layoffs weren’t confined to one department and were across the company, some of the people said. Genesis has 145 employees left after Thursday’s layoffs.
Genesis is working with investment bank Moelis & Co. to evaluate its options for the future, including a potential chapter 11 filing, said some of the people.
A Genesis spokeswoman said that the firm is working with its advisers “to preserve client assets and move the business forward.”
The crypto lender has become the latest digital asset firm to struggle for survival. Last year was marked by a series of crypto bankruptcies as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates, deflating the most speculative investments. Blowups in the little-regulated sector trickled down to other companies, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the nascent industry. The Fed has signaled it will continue raising rates. Investors are bracing for more pain in crypto.
Genesis suffered steep losses from loans it supplied to the now-defunct trading firm Alameda Research and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Both Alameda and Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy last year.
“As we continue to navigate unprecedented industry challenges, Genesis has made the difficult decision to reduce our head count globally. These measures are part of our ongoing efforts to move our business forward,” a spokeswoman for Genesis said.
Last summer, Genesis cut 20% of its 260-person workforce—and its chief executive Michael Moro stepped down—after Three Arrows was forced to liquidate. Genesis had given the hedge fund a $2.4 billion loan with 50% collateral. Genesis has disagreed with this characterization, and Mr. Moro has said the collateral was closer to 80%.
The lender also struggled to keep leaders in its risk management team. Most recently, Michael Patchen, who served for only a few months as its chief risk manager, abruptly resigned in October, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Its woes deepened with the collapse of FTX. Genesis lent at least hundreds of millions of dollars to FTX’s sister trading firm Alameda Research before its implosion in November, according to people familiar with the matter.
Genesis paused loan originations and redemptions on Nov. 16. As a result of Genesis’s move, crypto exchange Gemini has $900 million of its customers’ funds trapped in Genesis. Genesis used Gemini as a partner for its yield program.
Genesis has sought lifelines in the form of an emergency loan of $1 billion from investors.
The company also tried to raise capital from crypto exchange Binance and private equity giant Apollo Global Management.
Moelis was brought on last year by Genesis to help the company shore up its finances and figure out a road map for its future, according to a company statement.
Gemini and other creditors to Genesis have attempted to recoup owed funds in recent weeks. Tensions between heads of both companies erupted into an open dispute on Twitter earlier this week.
Derar Islim, interim chief executive of crypto brokerage Genesis Global Trading, said Wednesday that the company needs more time to resolve the financial crisis brewing in its lending business and has made progress in reducing costs in its business lines.
Genesis is owned by the crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, which also operates crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments, crypto news outlet CoinDesk, mining and staking firm Foundry, crypto exchange Luno, data platform TradeBlock, wealth management firm HQ and DCG Real Estate.

The lawsuit alleges that the former chief executive made false statements to investors about the soundness of Celsius’s financial condition then concealed its dire situation when the lender lost hundreds of millions of dollars in risky investments. Mr. Mashinsky falsely claimed that Celsius was safer than a bank and only lent assets to credible entities, the lawsuit said.
“Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin,” said Ms. James, a Democrat. “The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal.”
The lawsuit accuses Mr. Mashinsky of violating the state’s Martin Act, a broad law used to combat securities and commodities fraud, and a state general business law that allows the attorney general to investigate fraud.
A serial entrepreneur, Mr. Mashinsky launched Celsius in 2017, billing it as a safe and subversive alternative to traditional banks. Over five years, the company grew to be one of the largest crypto lenders, managing more than $20 billion in assets at its peak. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in July as the crypto market spiraled and after freezing customer withdrawals. Mr. Mashinsky resigned as Celsius’s CEO in September.
Celsius in a brief statement noted that Mr. Mashinsky no longer works at the company. His lawyer, Benjamin Allee, said Mr. Mashinsky “denies these allegations. He looks forward to vigorously defending himself in court.”
A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday ruled that $4.2 billion in cryptocurrency deposits in Celsius’s interest-bearing accounts belong to the firm, dealing a blow to thousands of customers who have been fighting to get back their money. 
Celsius also revealed in a bankruptcy filing in October that it had received a federal grand jury subpoena in June. Customers have filed a proposed class-action suit against Celsius and Mr. Mashinsky, accusing the company of operating like a Ponzi scheme. 
Ms. James’s office said that more than 26,000 New Yorkers had deposited about $440 million in Celsius as of Dec. 31, 2021.
In addition to restitution and damages, Ms. James is seeking to bar Mr. Mashinsky from engaging in business relating to the issuance or sale of securities and commodities in New York. She also wants to bar him from serving as an officer of companies operating in the state.

Seth Shapiro, a Justice Department official, said at an FTX bankruptcy court hearing Wednesday that the federal government has seized or is in the process of seizing Robinhood shares whose ownership is disputed by FTX and BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lender that collapsed in late November. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the dispute involves 56 million shares.
“We either believe these assets aren’t property of the bankruptcy estate,” or fall under some bankruptcy code exception, Mr. Shapiro told Judge John Dorsey on Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
Separately, Katharine Parker, a federal magistrate judge in New York, in December ordered the seizure of money that an FTX unit was keeping in accounts at Silvergate SI -4.00%
decrease; red down pointing triangle
Capital Corp., according to a court filing Wednesday. An earlier court filing put the amount at about $93 million.
The Justice Department has accused FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried of stealing billions of dollars of customer money. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said Tuesday that his office had formed an FTX task force, and that one of its goals is to trace and recover victim assets.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also filed an affidavit with a New York federal court in order to seize FTX funds.
Meanwhile, court-appointed liquidators in the Bahamas have been attempting to recover remaining funds inside bank accounts in the U.S., some of which have been frozen following the crypto exchange’s collapse. However, federal authorities have preempted some of that dispute and seized at least some of the disputed funds as their criminal probe of FTX and Mr. Bankman-Fried has widened.
The federal government’s entrance into a matrix of competing claims for control over FTX assets will likely complicate customers’ ability to recover their money, which has been out of reach since November.
FTX lawyer James Bromley said during Wednesday’s hearing that the seizures were ordered by the court in connection with the criminal case in the Southern District of New York involving Mr. Bankman-Fried. He pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud this week.
“The question as to the ownership of those Robinhood HOOD 3.10%
increase; green up pointing triangle
shares was an open question before the seizure took place,” Mr. Bromley said. “We wanted to make sure that it was clear the Robinhood shares that were being seized were being seized from accounts” that aren’t currently under the direct control of the bankrupt FTX.
Silvergate on Wednesday filed a copy of Judge Parker’s warrant that led to the seizure of FTX’s funds at the bank. The bank made the filing to a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware handling the insolvency of FTX Digital Markets, a Bahamas-based subsidiary of FTX that housed the company’s international exchange.
Bahamian regulators placed FTX Digital Markets into liquidation in November, just before FTX’s new chief executive, John J. Ray III, placed about 100 FTX subsidiaries under chapter 11 protection in the U.S.
FTX Digital Markets’ liquidators, appointed by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas, had previously asked to transfer $93 million out of Silvergate and another roughly $50 million held at Moonstone Bank in Washington state into accounts they control.
“It would be irresponsible to leave significant U.S. assets (more than $140 million) in the hands of two small crypto banks,” the liquidators wrote last month. They pointed to Silvergate being the subject of at least four class-action lawsuits brought by FTX creditors and Silvergate shareholders since November.
Silvergate said that the liquidators could have asked for consensual access instead of attempting to obtain it through a court order. “Silvergate, having repeatedly confirmed that the accounts had been frozen, vigorously disputes the implications that the funds are, in any way, at risk of loss,” the bank wrote.
Authorities’ seizure of FTX funds raises questions about how, or if, customers can expect to recover their money locked on the crypto platform. Mr. Ray told Congress in December that FTX’s U.S. entity isn’t solvent, putting into doubt whether American customers can expect to see their funds returned. He also noted that FTX’s international customers’ funds were commingled with accounts belonging to Alameda Research, whose own losses on bad crypto bets total in the billions, he said.
“We believe we have rights with respect to those assets that can be dealt with later,” FTX’s Mr. Bromley said of the seized assets. “We are in alignment at the present time with the U.S. government and the law enforcement officials in taking these steps.”
Mr. Shapiro of the Justice Department said the government would file a notice of seizure so the court is aware of what has been seized by the U.S. government.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-fdic-and-occ-warn-banks-about-cryptocurrency-risks-11672783296,"Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC Warn Banks About Cryptocurrency Risks",https://images.wsj.net/im-696232?width=220&height=147,Paul Kiernan,"Updated Jan. 3, 2023 6:37 pm ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,Regulators say holding cryptocurrencies is likely inconsistent with safe banking practices,"WASHINGTON—A group of powerful bank regulators on Tuesday highlighted what they said were a litany of risks stemming from cryptocurrencies and expressed skepticism that the assets can be safely held by the financial institutions they oversee.
The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that recent failures of major crypto firms led them to exercise caution in reviewing banks’ proposals to engage with the market. They highlighted fraud and scams, market volatility, legal uncertainty, and weak risk-management and governance practices at crypto firms, among other things, as reasons for concern. 
“It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,” the regulators said in a joint statement. Based on their experience, they said, issuing or holding cryptocurrencies “is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.”
The warning reinforced policy makers’ dimming view of cryptocurrencies following the collapse of trading platform FTX in November and suggested bank regulators could throw up more hurdles for firms in the sector. Prosecutors say FTX and its affiliates misused customer funds, and they have charged its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, with criminal offenses including fraud. He has pleaded not guilty. 
The agencies said banks “are neither prohibited nor discouraged” from providing services to customers of any specific type. They said they are “continuing to assess whether or how” banks can deal with cryptocurrencies in a way that adequately ensures the institutions’ safety and soundness, consumer protection and legal compliance. 
Since the 2009 launch of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, most large banks have been reluctant to embrace the asset class. The Securities and Exchange Commission says it considers most cryptocurrencies to be unregistered securities, making them legally risky for regulated firms to offer or sell. 
But a handful of banks have gotten involved. California bank Silvergate Capital Corp. transformed itself from a small lender into a bank for cryptocurrency investors and exchanges and gets 90% of its deposits from such digital customers. Its stock has fallen nearly 80% in the past three months amid questions about its exposure to the industry.
In the statement Tuesday, the bank regulators said they “have significant safety and soundness concerns with business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities or have concentrated exposures to the crypto-asset sector.” 
They also warned of the susceptibility of so-called stablecoins—cryptocurrencies backed by supposedly safe, dollar-denominated assets—to potential runs by spooked investors. Such events could cause sudden deposit outflows for banks that hold cash reserves for stablecoin issuers. 
The second-largest stablecoin issuer, Circle Internet Financial Ltd., said recently that it had more than $11 billion in cash held at banks including Silvergate, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Citizens Trust Bank and Customers Bank. 
Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer, said in an email that the risks highlighted by regulators Tuesday “were mostly about greed, arrogance and in some cases fraud, not blockchain finance or neutral, decentralized technology.”
Customers Bank said in an emailed statement that it has worked closely with federal and state regulators on its blockchain-based payment system and other crypto-related banking products. The bank said it is confident in its risk-management standards and “welcomes the opportunity to work cooperatively with regulators and policymakers.”
A spokesman for BNY Mellon declined to comment. Representatives of Silvergate and Citizens Trust Bank didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30 years old, entered his not-guilty plea to all eight criminal counts he faces before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in federal court in Manhattan. It was his second appearance in a U.S. court after the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange.
Prosecutors have accused him of stealing billions of dollars of customer funds from FTX and of defrauding investors and lenders to his trading firm, Alameda Research. He also evaded campaign-finance contribution limits and reporting requirements when he made millions of dollars in illegal political contributions funded by Alameda, prosecutors said.
Mr. Bankman-Fried has previously said he didn’t intend to commit fraud but has acknowledged making mistakes while running the company.
The former chief executive, who is being detained at his parents’ California home but returned to New York for the hearing, sat at the defense table between his lawyers, who entered the plea on his behalf. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told the judge the October trial would last about four weeks, while Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Bankman-Fried, estimated it would last from two to three weeks.
Judge Kaplan set the next court hearing for May 18.
Two of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s associates, Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, pleaded guilty to related charges last month and are cooperating with prosecutors’ investigation into the alleged scheme. Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Tuesday that his office had formed an FTX task force, drawing on prosecutors from multiple units, including those focused on securities fraud, public corruption and money laundering. Mr. Williams said his office “is working around the clock to respond to the implosion of FTX.”
In December, Mr. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and, after consenting to extradition, flown to New York.
During his first appearance in federal court last month, a magistrate judge released him on a $250 million bond, which was secured by his parents’ home in Stanford, Calif., where he was ordered detained while awaiting trial.
While Mr. Bankman-Fried wasn’t required to deposit any money with the court, if he were to fail to appear in court, the government could move to seize his parents’ property.
The judge required that Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents and one nonfamily member co-sign the $250 million bond and that two additional people sign other bonds in lesser amounts.
In a letter Tuesday, lawyers for Mr. Bankman-Fried asked Judge Kaplan to order that the names of the sureties, or signers of the lesser bonds, not be disclosed to the public.
The lawyers said that Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents had been subjected to intense media scrutiny and threats.
“There is serious cause for concern that the two additional sureties would face similar intrusions on their privacy as well as threats and harassment if their names appear unredacted on their bonds or their identities are otherwise publicly disclosed,” the letter said.
Judge Kaplan granted the request, though said he would allow members of the media or others to contest the sealing of the information.
Ms. Sassoon, the prosecutor, asked the judge to impose an additional bond condition barring Mr. Bankman-Fried from transferring or accessing FTX and Alameda assets.
Mr. Cohen said his client hadn’t accessed those funds, echoing a point Mr. Bankman-Fried had made in a tweet last week.
“In terms of defendant’s tweet, that it was not him, we don’t put full stock in that,” Ms. Sassoon said.
Judge Kaplan granted prosecutors’ request.

The back-and-forth on Monday deals another blow to a sector struggling for credibility, especially since the collapse of FTX and its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. The fall of the two companies led to outflows from other crypto exchanges and the near-erasure in value of coins tied to FTX and Alameda, domino effects in a closely linked industry. 
Crypto investors are closely watching the negotiations between the Gemini exchange, which was founded by Mr. Winklevoss and his brother, and the lender Genesis Global Capital. Last year saw the bankruptcies of multiple crypto firms, capped off with FTX. Traders are going into the new year wary of further turmoil. 
Genesis, the lending unit of Mr. Silbert’s crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group, halted loan originations and redemptions on Nov. 16 after it couldn’t meet client withdrawal requests. Genesis cited the demise of FTX. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Genesis had loans outstanding to FTX’s sister trading firm.
Genesis is a lending partner of Gemini’s earn program, which allows retail users to lend out their cryptocurrencies in exchange for annual interest rates as high as 8%. Gemini paused customer withdrawals from the earn program on the same day that Genesis made its announcement. Gemini’s 340,000 earn users have deposited more than $900 million in the earn program, according to Mr. Winklevoss.
Crypto exchange Gemini has banded together with other creditors of Genesis to find a way for the crypto lender to return owed assets.  
In an open letter to Mr. Silbert on Monday, Mr. Winklevoss said Genesis creditors have repeatedly tried to get together with Mr. Silbert and sent multiple proposals to him, including one delivered on Christmas Day. 
“Despite this, you continue to refuse to get into a room with us to hash out a resolution,” Mr. Winklevoss wrote. “Every time we ask you for tangible engagement, you hide behind lawyers, investment bankers, and process. After six weeks, your behavior is not only completely unacceptable, it is unconscionable.”
Mr. Silbert responded on Twitter, saying his company had delivered a proposal on Dec. 29 “and has not received any response.”
Mr. Winklevoss also said that Mr. Silbert’s parent company DCG owes $1.675 billion to its subsidiary Genesis. Mr. Silbert replied on Twitter that DCG didn’t borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding. 
Mr. Silbert said in a letter to investors in November that DCG owes Genesis about $575 million that is due in May 2023, in addition to a $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis due in June 2032.
Last year, DCG took on liabilities from Genesis after the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on the $2.4 billion in loans it took out from Genesis, prompting the issuance of the $1.1 billion promissory note while DCG tries to recover assets from Three Arrows’ liquidation proceedings.
Spokespeople for Gemini and DCG declined to comment beyond Mr. Winklevoss’s and Mr. Silbert’s tweets.
This isn’t the first dispute between crypto titans to spill onto Twitter in recent weeks. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Changpeng Zhao of Binance sniped at each other shortly before FTX imploded in November.
Mr. Bankman-Fried is likely to appear in court Tuesday to enter his plea to fraud charges by U.S. prosecutors. He is likely to plead not guilty, the Journal reported.

Alameda was applying Wall Street-style wizardry to the crypto world—and outsiders thought it was winning big. But little was known beyond the firm about its trades, which included a lucrative early bet involving bitcoin in Japan. Alameda had no outside investors and didn’t disclose its performance.
Before he was charged In December by federal prosecutors with fraud and other crimes, then arrested, Mr. Bankman-Fried said in interviews that Alameda had prospered until it was tripped up in November by a crash in crypto prices. At that point, he said, he was no longer running Alameda, and by the time he figured out what had gone wrong, it was too late.
But a closer look at Alameda shows it never was particularly good at investing, and Mr. Bankman-Fried continued to be deeply involved in it even after he stepped down as chief executive in October 2021, according to former employees, company documents, investors and federal regulators. The firm took big gambles, winning some and losing plenty. And Mr. Bankman-Fried tried continually to borrow cash and crypto to fuel those bets, promising lenders double-digit interest rates.
In 2020, Citigroup Inc. was exploring partnerships with Alameda and others to launch a crypto lending business. Austin Campbell, then the bank’s co-head of digital assets rates trading, said he grew skeptical of the firm after getting vague answers to his questions.
“The thing that I picked up on immediately that was causing us heartburn was the complete lack of a risk-management framework that they could articulate in any meaningful way,” he said.
As it grew, Alameda poured billions of dollars—money federal prosecutors recently said was stolen from FTX customers—into wagers that the crypto universe would grow. It bet on esoteric cryptocurrencies and numerous crypto-related startups. It bought real estate and gave donations to politicians.
In 2022, it all came crashing down. In November, both companies sought bankruptcy protection, owing customers billions of dollars, undermining confidence in the broader crypto market.
Mr. Bankman-Fried has blamed the loss of customer funds on sloppy record-keeping and a bank-account issue that allowed Alameda to cover large losses with money destined for FTX. He is likely to plead not guilty to fraud charges at a Jan. 3 hearing, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
But Caroline Ellison, Alameda’s CEO at the time of the collapse, and Gary Wang, its co-founder, have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and are cooperating with prosecutors.
A lawyer for Mr. Bankman-Fried and spokespeople for FTX, its new CEO, and Alameda didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Wang’s lawyer has said that his client has accepted responsibility for his actions. Ms. Ellison has apologized for her role in the collapse.
Potential employees were told that Mr. Bankman-Fried started the firm partly so he could give away some of its profits as effective altruism, a movement that declares the aim of directing donations to where they can do the most good. One of the ways he raised capital for trading was to borrow it from wealthy individuals active in that world. He came back loaded with crypto, including a loan of about $100 million worth of ether from Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn.
Alameda’s first big trade was an arbitrage play in Japan, where bitcoin commanded higher prices. Traders who could navigate the complexities of the crypto scene there could profit by buying the digital currency elsewhere and selling it to Japanese buyers for more.
The trading opportunity was fleeting. Alameda made between $10 million and $30 million in profits before the price gap closed in early 2018, according to people familiar with the trade. The money used to fund the trade, though, was expensive, cutting into the gain.
Meanwhile, Alameda’s trading algorithm, which was designed to make a large number of automated, rapid-fire trades, was losing money by guessing the wrong way on price moves, according to people familiar with the trading.
Mr. Tallinn recalled his loan. By the spring of 2018, Alameda’s assets declined by more than two-thirds, to about $30 million, partly due to a big loss on XRP, the tokens of the Ripple payment network, those people said.
Mr. Bankman-Fried needed ever-larger sums to keep the operation afloat. In late 2018, he promised potential lenders of cash or crypto annual returns of up to 20%, according to people familiar with the pitches.
When one prospective lender asked about Alameda’s financials, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s lawyer explained that the firm often handled large amounts of bitcoin but offered no detailed financial information, according to a document viewed by the Journal.
“We know the owner of Alameda and consider him of the highest reputation in the industry,” Daniel Friedberg wrote on the letterhead of his law firm, Fenwick & West LLP. He later took a job as FTX’s chief regulatory officer. Neither Mr. Friedberg nor his former law firm responded to requests for comment.
In January 2019, 1,500 people gathered in Singapore for the inaugural Binance Blockchain Week. Alameda paid $150,000 to sponsor the conference, which was billed as discussion of the future of the nascent digital-assets industry. People who attended said Mr. Bankman-Fried used the forum to seek new lenders.
Prospective lenders got a pamphlet that said the company had $55 million in assets under management, said people familiar with the finances. Most of it was money it had borrowed to fund its trades.
In February 2019, Mr. Bankman-Fried began moving the firm from California to Hong Kong. A team of about 20 employees put in long hours. The crypto markets were always open.
The failure of several exchanges used by investors to buy and sell crypto inspired Mr. Bankman-Fried to start his own. The idea, he told many people, was to build an operation that would cater to institutional investors looking for a safe place to do business.
Mr. Bankman-Fried seemed convinced he could work out the kinks that had doomed other exchanges. He had another advantage: Alameda, by then one of the biggest traders in crypto, would bring its transactions to the exchange. FTX went live in April 2019.
Mr. Bankman-Fried used Alameda to fuel FTX’s growth. The trading firm served as the exchange’s primary market maker, meaning that it was always available to buy and sell if other traders wanted to. Alameda sometimes took the losing side of a trade to attract customers to the exchange, according to people familiar with its strategy.
Mr. Bankman-Fried devised a plan for Alameda to borrow funds from the exchange, according to recent lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the nation’s top market regulators.
He told Mr. Wang, his co-founder, to write code that would allow Alameda to carry a negative balance on FTX, regardless of how much collateral it posted with the exchange, the SEC said. Mr. Bankman-Fried also made sure that Alameda’s collateral on FTX wouldn’t automatically be sold if its value fell below a certain level, the SEC said.
That effectively gave Alameda a line of credit from FTX. Mr. Bankman-Fried, the SEC said, repeatedly told Mr. Wang and other FTX engineers to raise the de facto borrowing limit to tens of billions of dollars.
All the while, Mr. Bankman-Fried was publicly claiming that FTX was doing things by the book.
Record-keeping at Alameda had always been spotty, according to the SEC and CFTC. That didn’t change much after FTX launched. Assets and debts were “generally treated as interchangeable,” the SEC said in a complaint filed in December.
Since the collapse of FTX, Mr. Bankman-Fried has tried to put distance between himself and Alameda. “FTX was a full-time job,” he told the Journal In December. “I didn’t have enough brain cycles left to understand everything going on at Alameda if I wanted to.”
Federal regulators said he was deeply involved in both FTX and Alameda. People who worked at Alameda worked on FTX, and vice versa, according to former employees. The two companies shared technology and office space, according to the SEC and CFTC. Top executives, including Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang, worked closely together at the Bahamas penthouse that doubled as their home.
Mr. Bankman-Fried ordered Ms. Ellison, with whom he had been romantically involved, to use Alameda’s buying power to artificially inflate the value of a cryptocurrency the trading firm was borrowing against, the SEC said.
When brokerage firm Crypto Finance Group asked FTX for the paperwork it needed to trade on FTX, the exchange sent over a scan of its ownership structure on a sheet of paper with an Alameda watermark, said Patrick Heusser, the brokerage’s chief commercial officer. FTX asked for any dollar transfers to be sent to Alameda, he said.
“Those are the red flags we should have caught up on,” Mr. Heusser said.
Some FTX and Alameda clients worried that Alameda might profit from trading information gleaned from FTX. Members of both divisions participated in conversations with investors. In the traditional finance world, exchanges don’t operate active investment arms.
“The potential conflicts of interest and embedded risks are large when a digital assets exchange also acts as the largest market maker,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at digital-investment firm Arca, in a blog post to clients and others on his company’s website in October 2020.
Over time, crypto investors, including Mr. Dorman, took comfort in the fact that Alameda’s team was likely more interested in building automated trading models than in tidbits of information they might derive from their colleagues at FTX.
By late 2021, Alameda had narrowed its focus to niche trading strategies, executives there have said. While rivals such as Wintermute Trading Ltd and Jump Trading Group made markets in bitcoin and ether, which were relatively widely traded, Alameda specialized in trading so-called alt-coins, including two that pay homage to the Shiba Inu dog breed, as well as coins introduced by FTX itself, such as FTT.
Alameda made over $1 billion in profits in 2021, according to people familiar with the results. That year, cryptocurrencies of all kinds soared, even ones created as a joke.
“They were very good at finding and extracting these special opportunities,” said Wintermute Chief Executive Evgeny Gaevoy.
Mr. Bankman-Fried named Ms. Ellison and another employee, Sam Trabucco, Alameda’s co-CEOs in October 2021.
December 2021 was close to the peak for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had touched its record high a month earlier. FTX had raised more than a billion dollars from venture capitalists, and Mr. Bankman-Fried was weeks away from landing another $400 million in funding for the exchange.
Although by then Mr. Bankman-Fried had stepped down as CEO of Alameda, he continued to be deeply involved in its decision-making, according to the SEC.
He traveled to the presidential palace in the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan, a hub of bitcoin mining activity 6,800 miles from his Bahamas base. Sitting with a small group of Western asset managers and hedge-fund executives, he made the case for crypto despite concerns about the enormous amount of energy needed to create it.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s support of crypto miners—the troves of computers needed to unlock new cryptocurrencies—was of great financial importance to Alameda. The trading firm had pumped more than $100 million into one such mining company with an array of data centers in Kazakhstan.
Shortly after the meeting, Alameda began pumping another $1 billion into the company, Genesis Digital Assets. It was Alameda’s largest venture-capital investment by far, according to a company document reviewed by the Journal. The timing was terrible: The price of bitcoin soon collapsed, and with it the profits of miners.
Alameda sank $1.4 billion into startups in 2021, according to the company document, up from just $10.5 million a year earlier.
The May collapse of a pair of cryptocurrencies triggered a series of defaults. Mr. Bankman-Fried came to the rescue, extending hundreds of millions of dollars to prop up failing firms.
But Alameda’s investments were souring fast. Lenders began asking for their money back. Mr. Bankman-Fried, the CFTC said, pushed the firm to borrow billions of dollars worth of FTX customer funds to cover its debts.
A few months before his empire collapsed, Mr. Bankman-Fried was privately musing about shutting down Alameda.
“I only started thinking about this today, and so haven’t vetted it much yet,” he wrote in a document he shared with others, according to the CFTC complaint. “But: I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago.”

“I am truly sorry for what I did,” Ms. Ellison, the former chief executive of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, said in a New York federal court, according to a transcript of the hearing made available Friday. “I knew that it was wrong.”
Ms. Ellison, 28 years old, and former FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang, 29, pleaded guilty Monday during separate hearings without notice to the public. Both agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation in exchange for the prospect of lighter sentences.
Ms. Ellison, a former romantic partner of Mr. Bankman-Fried, pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts, including fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. During her hearing, she admitted to conspiring to use billions of dollars from FTX customer accounts to repay loans Alameda had taken out to make risky investments.
FTX executives had enacted special settings that granted Alameda access to an unlimited line of credit without having to post collateral, pay interest on negative balances or be subject to margin calls, she said.
“I also understood that many FTX customers invested in crypto derivatives and that most FTX customers did not expect that FTX would lend out their digital asset holdings and fiat currency deposits to Alameda in this fashion,” she said.
Ms. Ellison also said she and Mr. Bankman-Fried worked with others to conceal the arrangement from lenders, including by hiding on quarterly balance sheets the extent of Alameda’s borrowing and the billions of dollars in loans that the firm had made to FTX executives and associates. Mr. Bankman-Fried was among the executives who received loans from Alameda, she said.
Under questioning from the judge, Ms. Ellison said she knew what she was doing was illegal.
She said that since FTX’s implosion, she has worked hard to assist in the recovery of customers’ assets and aid the government’s investigation. 
At the hearing, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams granted the request of federal prosecutors to temporarily seal all documents connected to Ms. Ellison’s plea agreement. At the time, Mr. Bankman-Fried was in a jail in the Bahamas after the Justice Department requested local police arrest him, and he had not yet formally consented to his transfer to U.S. custody. 
“We’re still expecting extradition soon, but given that he has not yet entered his consent, we think it could potentially thwart our law enforcement objectives to extradite him if Ms. Ellison’s cooperation were disclosed at this time,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told Judge Abrams. 
A lawyer for Ms. Ellison declined to comment. Ms. Ellison was ordered released on $250,000 bond at her plea hearing. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment. 
Mr. Wang pleaded guilty in front of the same judge. He told Judge Abrams he knew what he was doing was illegal and wrong. “As part of my employment at FTX, I was directed to and agreed to make certain changes to the platform’s code,” he said, adding that he executed the changes knowing they would give Alameda Research special privileges on the FTX platform.
A lawyer for Mr. Wang declined to comment. He has previously said that Mr. Wang takes his responsibilities as a cooperating witness seriously.
The Justice Department charged Mr. Bankman-Fried earlier this month with eight counts of fraud and conspiracy connected to the implosion of his company. He was released from custody on a $250 million bond on Thursday after making his first court appearance in New York following his extradition from the Bahamas. A federal magistrate judge set strict restrictions on Mr. Bankman-Fried, including ordering him to stay in his parents’ Palo Alto, Calif., home and be under electronic monitoring. 
Mr. Bankman-Fried has said he made mistakes that contributed to FTX’s demise, but he has denied engaging in fraud.
Judge Abrams, who presided over both plea hearings, said in a filing Friday evening that she would recuse herself from the case. Her husband is a partner at a law firm that advised FTX in 2021, as well as represented parties that may be adverse to FTX in other proceedings, the filing said.
A new judge hasn’t been assigned to the case.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-delays-tax-rules-for-crypto-brokers-11671824605,Biden Administration Delays Tax Rules for Crypto Brokers,https://images.wsj.net/im-691975?width=220&height=147,Andrew Duehren,"Dec. 23, 2022 2:43 pm ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,Cryptocurrency brokers don’t have to start reporting customers’ gains to IRS until the administration finishes writing the rules,"WASHINGTON—The Biden administration delayed a requirement that cryptocurrency brokers begin tracking and reporting investors’ gains to the Internal Revenue Service, punting on the original Jan. 1 timeline for a change that had been resisted by crypto brokers and some members of Congress. 
As part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021, Congress required brokers of digital assets to detail the proceeds of their customers’ transactions to the IRS in a 1099 form. The goal of the provision, estimated to raise $28 billion in revenue over 10 years, was to collect more taxes owed from crypto trading by imposing the same rules on the industry as apply to traditional securities brokers.  
But the IRS and the Treasury Department have yet to formulate the rules for enforcing the provision, leaving critical questions—such as the definition of a broker—unresolved. The IRS and the Treasury said on Friday that the new reporting requirements wouldn’t take effect until the agencies had finished writing the rules governing them. 
Some lawmakers have sought to amend the new reporting requirements by narrowing the definition of a broker. They, as well as cryptocurrency industry groups, have argued that the current definition could include bitcoin miners and other entities that may struggle to comply with the rules.
Washington’s approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry has come under fresh fire since the collapse of exchange FTX and the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Mr. Bankman-Fried and his team were major donors to both political parties and lobbied to try to create a regulatory regime friendly to the industry, which has lost much of its market value in the past year. 
The push to require crypto brokers to report on their customers’ gains is aimed at clamping down on crypto investors’ tax avoidance. In a recent court filing, the IRS said that in 2019 only about 100,000 tax returns reported crypto transactions. Surveys suggest tens of millions of Americans have bought or sold crypto.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-fried-to-make-first-appearance-in-u-s-court-11671730216,Sam Bankman-Fried Released on $250 Million Bond,https://images.wsj.net/im-690522?width=220&height=147,Corinne Ramey,"Updated Dec. 22, 2022 5:31 pm ET",CRYPTOCURRENCY,FTX founder makes first U.S. court appearance following his extradition from the Bahamas,"FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was released on a $250 million bond Thursday and ordered to stay in his parents’ Palo Alto, Calif., home, after the former executive’s first appearance in a New York federal court following his extradition from the Bahamas.
Mr. Bankman-Fried, charged with engaging in criminal conduct that contributed to the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse, came to court shackled by the ankles and wearing a charcoal gray suit. He sat quietly at the defense table, flanked by his lawyers.
Mr. Bankman-Fried left the courthouse in a black SUV. At a later date he will enter a plea on charges that he engaged in fraud and other offenses, a federal magistrate judge said. The next court hearing is set for Jan. 3.
Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein set the bail package, which requires Mr. Bankman-Fried to be under electronic monitoring and restricts his travel to parts of northern California and New York.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos called Mr. Bankman-Fried’s alleged crimes “a fraud of epic proportions” and said he believed the $250 million bond was the largest ever. The judge said the bond would be cosigned by four financially responsible people, including one nonfamily member.
The evidence against Mr. Bankman-Fried includes the testimony of multiple cooperators and more than a dozen witnesses from FTX and his crypto-trading firm Alameda Research, as well as encrypted text messages and tens of thousands of pages of financial documents, Mr. Roos said.
The government agreed to the bail package, Mr. Roos said, because Mr. Bankman-Fried had consented to extradition. Mr. Bankman-Fried’s financial assets had diminished significantly from when they were worth billions of dollars, he said.
Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Bankman-Fried, said his client agreed to extradition, which could have taken years, in order to address the charges. He noted Mr. Bankman-Fried would be living with both of his parents, who helped to secure his bond with the equity interest in their home. They live near the Stanford University campus, in a home valued at roughly $4 million.
Judge Gorenstein said he agreed to the bail package because he believed Mr. Bankman-Fried wasn’t a flight risk and didn’t pose a danger to the community.
“It will be very difficult for this defendant to hide without being recognized,” the judge said. Mr. Bankman-Fried had achieved such notoriety that it would be impossible for him to conduct any financial transactions, the judge added.
When the judge asked if Mr. Bankman-Fried understood that he could be charged with bail jumping if he failed to appear in court, he looked at his lawyers then said, “Yes, I do.”
Mr. Bankman-Fried has acknowledged making mistakes while running the company, but has denied committing fraud.
His appearance caps a dramatic series of legal developments that began when Mr. Bankman-Fried told a Bahamas judge Wednesday morning that he wanted to be transferred immediately to the U.S. to face charges and try to “make the relevant customers whole.”
After U.S. officials had him on a plane en route to New York on Wednesday night, they announced that two of his closest associates had pleaded guilty to several criminal offenses and were cooperating with prosecutors.
Caroline Ellison, the former chief executive of Alameda Research, pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts, and former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang to four counts, according to their plea agreements. Their cooperation with investigators likely strengthens prosecutors’ case against Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is accused of defrauding customers, lenders and investors. It could also increase the legal peril facing other former FTX officials who played a role in the alleged scheme, as prosecutors have two insiders’ accounts and documents upon which they could rely at any future trials.
According to documents made public Thursday, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to defraud FTX customers from 2019 through November 2022 by misappropriating customer deposits and lending them to Alameda. Ms. Ellison also admitted participating in a scheme to defraud Alameda lenders by providing false information about its financial condition. She and Mr. Wang also pleaded guilty to misleading FTX investors.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a video statement Wednesday that the investigation into FTX is ongoing. He urged anyone who participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda to come forward soon.
A lawyer for Ms. Ellison declined to comment after her guilty plea was announced. A lawyer for Mr. Wang said his client took his obligations as a cooperating witness seriously.
Both Ms. Ellison, 28 years old, and Mr. Wang, 29, have ties to Mr. Bankman-Fried that predate his founding of FTX. Ms. Ellison and Mr. Bankman-Fried worked together at Jane Street, a quantitative-trading firm, and were once romantically involved. Mr. Wang and Mr. Bankman-Fried were in the same coed living group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed lawsuits against Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang late Wednesday for their roles in a scheme to defraud FTX investors. Both agreed to settle the SEC’s and CFTC’s claims and to accept liability, according to the regulators.
Mr. Bankman-Fried is also charged with conspiring with others to make illegal campaign contributions. Mr. Williams said Mr. Bankman-Fried made political contributions look like they were coming from wealthy associates when in reality they were funded by Alameda with money from stolen customer funds.
Mr. Bankman-Fried personally donated $40 million to political campaigns and committees—mostly to Democrats and liberal-leaning groups.
FTX’s new management has said it would try to recoup campaign contributions made by Mr. Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives to pay back creditors.

Caroline Ellison, who ran FTX’s sister trading firm Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, FTX’s former chief technology officer, both pleaded guilty this week to criminal offenses similar to those Mr. Bankman-Fried was charged with and are cooperating with federal investigators. 
In separate actions on Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also sued Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang, alleging they committed civil securities and commodities fraud. Both agreed to settle the SEC’s and CFTC’s claims and to accept liability.
Before Mr. Bankman-Fried’s arrest last week, he said in media interviews that he had stepped away from Alameda and couldn’t explain what went wrong there or how billions of dollars of FTX customer money ended up at the trading firm. 
U.S. authorities have made clear that they believe that it was Mr. Bankman-Fried who was calling the shots at the crypto empire—including at Alameda, even though Ms. Ellison was CEO. The regulators’ lawsuits reiterated their statements from last week that Mr. Bankman-Fried maintained control over Alameda’s major trading, investment and financial decisions. 
Still, this week’s legal filings reinforce that authorities plan to hold his deputies accountable too. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called for others who participated in alleged misconduct at FTX or Alameda to come forward.
“Now is the time to get ahead of it,” Mr. Williams said in a video statement Wednesday night.
Legal experts said the speed with which the two former executives entered into cooperative plea agreements is notable and suggests the U.S. government has a strong case.
“People generally don’t just come running in the door offering to help. They only do this when they’ve concluded that their situation is grave,” said Samuel Buell, a law professor at Duke University and a former federal prosecutor. “It’s remarkable. My conclusion would be that Sam Bankman-Fried’s legal situation is dire.”
Henry Pontell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said Ms. Ellison’s and Mr. Wang’s pleading guilty will put more pressure on Mr. Bankman-Fried to do the same.
“These pleas coming from those around the central figure are indicative of typical case-building in big, white-collar cases like this to go after the kingpin,” Mr. Pontell said.
A lawyer for Ms. Ellison declined to comment after her guilty plea was announced. A lawyer for Mr. Wang said his client took his obligations as a cooperating witness seriously.
A spokesman for Mr. Bankman-Fried declined to comment.
According to their plea agreements, Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang are each required to post a $250,000 bond, restrict travel to within the continental U.S. and surrender all travel documents.
A key part of the government’s accusations have centered on how money deposited by FTX customers was sent to Alameda from the start. It was then used to fund the trading firm and for Mr. Bankman-Fried to buy pricey real estate and make political donations, U.S. authorities have said.
Regulators said this week that Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang were aware of the misuse of customer money. But even in their legal filings against Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang, regulators put Mr. Bankman-Fried at the center.
Mr. Wang created the software code that gave Alameda virtually unlimited access to FTX customer assets, though it was at Mr. Bankman-Fried’s direction, regulators said. They also said that Ms. Ellison used the customer money for trading and high-risk investments, but that it was also at Mr. Bankman-Fried’s direction.
FTX and Alameda were deeply intertwined, sharing office space, employees and technology, regulators reiterated this week. Mr. Bankman-Fried and Ms. Ellison both had said publicly that the two companies operated separately. Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wang and Ms. Ellison had “widespread access to each other’s systems and accounts,” the CFTC said.
Mr. Wang, 29, met Mr. Bankman-Fried in high school at a summer camp for gifted young mathematicians. Both later attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were members of the same coed living group, Epsilon Theta. Mr. Bankman-Fried owned 90% of Alameda and Mr. Wang owned the other 10%, according to bankruptcy court filings.
Some of the FTX customer money diverted to Alameda was loaned to FTX executives including Mr. Bankman-Fried, who borrowed $1.3 billion, the SEC said. Mr. Wang took out $225 million, but the money was largely used by Mr. Bankman-Fried, the SEC said.
Mr. Wang did withdraw approximately $200,000 for his own purposes, the suit said.
The loans to Messrs. Bankman-Fried and Wang and others were “poorly documented” and “at times not documented at all.”
The SEC said that Ms. Ellison actively manipulated the price of hard-to-trade FTX-issued digital asset token FTT, allowing Alameda to inflate the value of its FTT holdings and use them as collateral for undisclosed loans from FTX customers and third-party lenders. On at least two occasions, Mr. Bankman-Fried instructed Ms. Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support its price against downward selling pressure, the SEC said.
Ms. Ellison, 28, graduated from Stanford University and met Mr. Bankman-Fried when the two worked at quantitative-trading firm Jane Street. After Mr. Bankman-Fried left to start Alameda, she eventually followed him. The two were at times romantically involved, the Journal previously reported.
On an FTX podcast episode in September, Mr. Bankman-Fried said that working professionally with close friends was a business advantage.
“If we keep a focus on having people who are super aligned and trustworthy internally…we will be able to move so much faster,” he said. “That has been a bit of a superpower.”

That puts him at odds with some lawmakers who say the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX trading platform shows that crypto needs its own set of guardrails and point out that Mr. Gensler’s enforcement strategy moved too slowly to stop FTX from imploding.
Mr. Gensler, a veteran regulator nominated by President Biden, hasn’t included major crypto regulations among the more than 40 rules he has proposed or finalized since taking office in April 2021. Rather, he has demanded crypto firms comply with existing SEC requirements for exchanges, broker-dealers and public companies.
“I’m very proud of what we’ve done and proud of the public voice, as well,” Mr. Gensler said in an interview.
Mr. Gensler has added more enforcement attorneys to the SEC’s crypto unit and shifted the agency’s litigation strategy from focusing on individual tokens to the trading platforms that sell cryptocurrencies to investors. His reasoning: There are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but only a handful of major platforms that cater to U.S. investors.
Since 2018, the SEC has brought or settled more than 90 lawsuits related to cryptocurrencies. More than 30 have come during Mr. Gensler’s time in office. The SEC chief has said the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are securities—like stocks and bonds—that should follow the agency’s rigorous disclosure requirements before being sold to the investing public.
The SEC filed suit Wednesday against two associates of Mr. Bankman-Fried. The agency also joined other federal agencies in suing Mr. Bankman-Fried after FTX filed for bankruptcy. It alleged the executives defrauded FTX’s investors, including major venture-capital firms.
But the SEC’s action didn’t come soon enough to protect FTX’s customers, who have been frozen out of their accounts and now face a long and uncertain path to recovering their assets.
“The SEC hasn’t written rules and has failed to foresee and prevent disasters in the industry and protect consumers, from Terra-Luna to FTX,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.) said in a hearing last week, referring to a pair of cryptocurrencies that collapsed earlier this year. Mr. Gottheimer, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, received nearly $20,000 in campaign donations from crypto executives, including Mr. Bankman-Fried, ahead of the 2022 midterms.
Industry advocates have characterized the FTX implosion as a classic fraud rather than evidence of inherent problems in crypto.
The FTX fiasco has brought heightened scrutiny of the SEC and its smaller sibling agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives and is vying for greater jurisdiction over crypto markets. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a hearing on Dec. 1 that FTX’s collapse showed why his agency should be given authority to oversee markets for the small number of cryptocurrencies that the SEC has declined to pursue, such as bitcoin.
Mr. Gensler, who led the CFTC under President Barack Obama, has said that he would support Congress giving that agency more powers to regulate such assets. But he said last month that the most recent attempt by lawmakers to write a bill for that purpose was too light-touch. The risk, he has said, is that new legislation could create loopholes that undermine a $100 trillion market for U.S. stocks and bonds in order to accommodate a crypto market worth less than $1 trillion globally.
Mr. Gensler and his staff have tried to negotiate with crypto platforms on a model for registering with the SEC. Before its downfall, FTX had partnered with stock-exchange operator IEX Group and was working on a plan to set up a licensed crypto platform with the SEC. Rival crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. has also met with the SEC but isn’t close to a framework that it believes works, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
But complying with SEC rules is unappealing for crypto firms. Trading platforms that currently operate as exchanges, brokers and custodians of assets would have to break up those functions into separate entities to avoid conflicts of interest. They would likely have to stop listing all but a handful of tokens that either the SEC agrees aren’t securities or that have themselves registered with the agency and filed disclosures.
Some academics have noted that U.S. regulators’ reluctance to accommodate crypto firms has likely limited the knock-on effects that the current downturn in crypto prices might have otherwise had on the broader economy.
In the interview, Mr. Gensler said the SEC has taken meaningful steps during his tenure to contain risk and limit wrong-doing in cryptocurrency markets. During his first few months in office, he met with industry leaders and delivered his core message: Come into compliance with SEC regulations or face enforcement.
In September 2021, the SEC subpoenaed the developer behind TerraUSD and Luna, the cryptocurrencies referred to by Mr. Gottheimer. The tokens crashed about eight months later.
Mr. Gensler said he moved quickly to limit Americans’ access to crypto platforms that offer investors a yield on their deposits. Such platforms look and feel like online banks but don’t comply with bank oversight.
Less than five months after Mr. Gensler took office, SEC notified Coinbase that it would sue the firm if it offered a yield-bearing crypto product to ordinary investors. Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong accused the SEC of “really sketchy behavior,” but ultimately scuttled the plan. Since then, a succession of crypto-lending platforms have frozen withdrawals or filed for bankruptcy after making bad loans with customers’ deposits.
“We chose, strategically, to really focus our attention on that,” Mr. Gensler said, noting that yield-bearing crypto products had been proliferating rapidly in the summer of 2021. “And I’m very proud that the crypto-lending footprint in the U.S.—noncompliant as it is—is much smaller today.”
